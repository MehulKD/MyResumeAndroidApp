MyResumeAndroidApp
==================

This application is basically an Android "my Resume" App. Used mainly for CV for example.

Here is the link to Google Play to take a look at it:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fernandocejas.mycv

The idea is to learn:
-How to adapt applications to both mobile phones and tablets. 
-Use patterns for support different screen resolutions and densities.
-Open pdf files using the Android built-in Intent system from the assets directory.
-Use the activity helper pattern.

The app has a minimun sdk version of 14 (Ice Cream Sandwich but if you wanna support older versions, just add ActionBarSherlock and everything will work like a charm.

TODO:
-A refactor is needed for certain views.
-Add tests (soon)

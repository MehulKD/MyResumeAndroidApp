MyResumeAndroidApp
==================

This application is basically an Android "my Resume" App. Used mainly for CV for example.


Here is the link to Google Play to take a look at it:

<p><p>The idea is to learn:
<p><b>-How to adapt applications to both mobile phones and tablets.</b>
<p><b>-Use patterns for support different screen resolutions and densities.</b>
<p><b>-Open pdf files using the Android built-in Intent system from the assets directory.</b>
<p><b>-Use the activity helper pattern.


<p><p>The app has a minimun sdk version of 14 (Ice Cream Sandwich but if you wanna support older versions, just add ActionBarSherlock and everything will work like a charm.


<p><p>TODO:
<p>-A refactor is needed for certain views.
<p>-Add tests (soon)
